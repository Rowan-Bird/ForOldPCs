<h1>The site for vintage comptuers</h1>
<p>this page was designed for Mac OS 8.1 in qemu-system-m68k</p>
<br>
<p>Links:</p>
<p>I can't link to any sites that would work under Netscape 4, which I assume you're using because that's what I'm using, though it should work in just about any browser</p>
<br>
<p>Files:</p>
<p>Made this website to share some of my files, mainly because Stuffit Expander is a pain in the ass, and I'd really like to do away with it</p>
